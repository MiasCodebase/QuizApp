/**
 * Provides the service layer for the quiz application.
 * <p>
 * This package defines the {@link serviceLayer.QuizService} interface
 * as an abstraction for quiz-related data retrieval and management.
 * It includes concrete implementations such as {@link serviceLayer.FakeQuizService}
 * for generating test data and {@link serviceLayer.DefaultQuizService} as a stub
 * for the future real implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The service layer mediates between the presentation layer and
 * the underlying data sources, encapsulating business logic
 * and data fetching operations.
